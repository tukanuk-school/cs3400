# Know the:
- c++ multi paradigm programming language
- know the different paradigms (wk1 slides)
- imperative 
- procedural
- modular adds encapsulation
- object based paridigm
- oo nice to inherit methods
- generic paridigm 
	- templates
		- occurs at compile time

- if you are not using runtime polymorphism (virtual) you don't need
- turing complete: it can be used as a language to compute something
- c++ one definition rule. any definition written there is exactly one definition
- 

## Part one is:
- short answer
- fill in the blank
- t/f

## Part two:
- various programming bits
- Calling some algorithms
- *know how to use the iterators*
	- ++ your way through them 
	- * to access them

- STL
	- slide 26,27: **Strict weak ordering**
		- if a < b is false,  you don't know anything
		- if a < b is true, you know something
