  // The boss wants to give a 2% pay raise to employees whose salary is 
  // between $20,000 and $30,000! Follow the instructions in the comments
  // below to do this...

  // In <algorithm> there is an algorithm called find_if() which we'll call
  // twice storing the results in two variables: low_end and upper_end:
  //
  //   * low_end: the first find_if() will determine the FIRST iterator 
  //       position where e.salary >= 20000.0 && e.salary <= 30000.0 is true,
  //       OR, the end iterator position if there was no match, and,
  //       NOTE: The first find_if() call must start from the "beginning"
  //             iterator!
  //
  //   * upper_end: the second call will determine the ONE-PAST-THE-LAST 
  //       iterator position where e.salary >= 20000.0 && e.salary <= 30000.0
  //       is true, OR, the end iterator position if there was no match.
  //       NOTE: The second find_if() call must start from the low_end
  //             iterator!
  //
  // HINTS: 
  //   * Do this as TWO variable declarations.
  //   * Each variable declaration can either be:
  //       auto low_end = /* find_if() code */;
  //       auto upper_end = /* find_if() code */;
  //     OR:
  //       vector<employee>::iterator low_end = /* find_if() code */;
  //       vector<employee>::iterator upper_end = /* find_if() code */;
  //     but, clearly, auto is much simpler.
  //   * Read more about find_if() in the Josuttis text and/or 
  //     cppreference.com.
  //#error write code here

  // Now that you have the half-open range [low_end,upper_end)
  // you can increase all employees' salaries in that range!
  // In exactly two lines of code, write a for loop as follows:
  //   FOR "INIT" CLAUSE: Use auto to declare a variable i whose
  //     initial value is low_end.
  //   FOR "TEST" CLAUSE: Keep looping while i != upper_end.
  //   FOR "INCREMENT" CLAUSE: Write ++i.
  //     NOTE: DON'T WRITE i++!!
  //   FOR LOOP BODY: Since the iterator i points to an employee,
  //     you can access an employee struct's salary member
  //     with i->salary. Thus, in a single line of code, use the *= 
  //     operator to increase the employee's salary by 2%.
  //#error write code here

  // output data...
  //  ---> cout << "SALARY_ADJUST: " << employees << endl;

  // Finally, know you can use <algorithm>s, etc. where the
  // "beginning" and "end" iterators are not the container's
  // beginning and end iterators!
  //
  // Since you already have [low_end,upper_end), write the
  // single line of code to REVERSE all container data in the
  // range [low_end,upper_end) by calling <algorithm>'s
  // reverse() function.
  //
  // See the Josuttis text and/or cppreference.com for the
  // definition of reverse. (Use the two argument version.)
  //#error write code here

  // output data...
  //  ---> cout << "AFTER_REVERSE: " << employees << endl;
